This past weekend I spent Saturday with my Thursday-night orchestra (<a href="https://www.philharmoniamundimontreal.com/orchestre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philharmonia Mundi</a>) playing at a cabin compound in the woods. It was decorated for a wedding, but we made the most of it and had a great time with plenty of food, beer, and Beethoven!
